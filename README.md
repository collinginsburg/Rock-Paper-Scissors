Heyo! This is my attempt at making my favorite elementary school game, Rock Paper Scissors. I don't know what was so fascinating about the simple hand symbols, but it was absoolutely enthralling and I tried on many occasions to break the logic of the game...ie. by inserting (natural disaster) to make up for a bad hand. Maybe on a later addition of this game, I can insert a ~wild card~....


update 4-21-21: Success! Game of first to 5 works splendidly, and its simply played via alerts on both mobile. I'm definitely excited to create a GUI for the game in the future!!!
